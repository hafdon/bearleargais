  ---

Technically there are five noun cases (tuisil) in Irish. These are:
- nominative
- accusative
- genitive
- dative
- vocative.

In the official standard, however, there are only 3 cases, since the nominative, accusative and dative are combined to form one case. 

In English grammars, the nominative/accusative/dative are therefore combined as a "common case". 

However, the dative has its own forms in some dialects and in older literature. In addition, other lenition and eclipse rules apply in the dative, so the term "dative" is not omitted here.[^1] The nominative and accusative have been the same for centuries, so that 4 cases remain: nominative/accusative, genitive, dative and vocative. Here, all 5 cases are described individually, since they are often treated individually in Irish grammars.
