# Chapter 13: Sentence and Syntax 
Gaeilge: _Caibidil a Tr√≠ D√©ag: Abairt agus Comhr√©ir_

## Change of word order
Gaeilge: _Athr√∫ Ord na bhFocal_

The word order in Irish is fundamentally quite rigid (Predicate-Subject-Object PSO or Verb-Subject-Object VSO, see [Satzgliedfolge (sentence order)](https://braesicke.de/satz2.htm#wortfolge)), so that simple adjustments are very limited. Even through intonation, individual parts of a sentence cannot be easily emphasized and highlighted, as is possible in English, because the emphasis in the sentence depends on the function.

To achieve emphasis (*b√©im*)[^beim], certain mechanisms for changing the word order must therefore be used.

Comparable forms of emphasis exist in French (there called *mise en relief*).

### Using the Copula

Emphasis using a copula construction [^copula-construction] is the most common variant for changing word order in Irish.

There are two main variants that also exist in German, although less frequently:

#### The Cleft Sentence**
Gaeilge: _An abairt scoilte_

The part of the sentence to be emphasized is "split off" from the sentence structure, moves to the beginning of the sentence, and appears as the predicate of the [Copula](https://braesicke.de/kopul1.htm) in a copula sentence. The rest of the sentence follows as a relative clause.

- üòÆ‚ùó *(Is) teach a th√≥gann s√©* (It is a ¬´house¬ª that he is building.)
- üòêüíô _T√≥gann s√© teach_ (He builds a house; he is building a house)

#### The Blocking Sentence
Gaeilge: _An abairt bhr√©agscoilte_
Aka: Pseudo-cleft sentence

This represents a construction similar to the German example: "What he is building is a house."

In this construction, the part of the sentence to be emphasized moves to the end of the sentence. However, it is represented at the beginning of the sentence by a pronoun. In German, this pronoun is "was", in Irish it is "√©" in "is √© rud" or in "s√©ard".

Following the pronoun in Irish (unlike in German) is a relative clause. In contrast to the cleft sentence, the relative clause here usually has a clear reference word (usually "rud" or shortened to "rd" in "s√©ard").

e.g.: Is √© rud a th√≥gann s√© n√° teach = What he is building is a house
        S√©ard a th√≥gann s√© teach = What he is building is a house

Cleft and blocking sentences are common in Irish. 





[^beim]: Br√§sicke originally listed _treisi√∫_ and _neart√∫_ but as far as I know the Irish term for emphasis is _b√©im_. [-ZW]

[^copula-construction]: The basic structure of the cleft sentence and the blocking sentence as copula constructions is as follows:\
    (Color coding: **Predicate**, **Subject**)
    
    | Cleft Sentence:   |   **Is + Emphasis + Relative Clause**   |
    | Blocking Sentence:   |   **Is + √© (+ rud) + Relative Clause + (n√°) + Emphasis**   |\
    
    The *Cleft Sentence* is formally a [Classification](https://braesicke.de/kopul5.htm#klassatz) or [Identification Sentence](https://braesicke.de/kopul5.htm#idsatz) (depending on whether the emphasized part is considered *definite* or *indefinite*).\
    The *Blocking Sentence* is always an Identification Sentence - specifically, an [Identification Sentence with Subject Before the Predicate](https://braesicke.de/kopul5.htm#idre), regardless of whether the emphasized part is definite or indefinite.
